# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I research how to develop and operate large and complex software-intensive application systems. A major focus of my work is the interaction between different software development and operation phases. My methods include model-based software engineering (MBSE), software architecture, and continuous software engineering. I develop methods and tools in these areas and evaluate them empirically.
