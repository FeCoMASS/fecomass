The goal of the FeCoMASS project is to provide more flexibility in model-driven engineering by investigating foundations of decomposition and composition mechanisms specifically for model- based analyses for tomorrowâ€™s increasingly heterogeneous and complex systems. For this purpose, we will investigate in (1) (de)compositional semantics for modelling languages and analysis techniques to ensure sound analysis results, (2) concepts and guidelines for flexible use and reuse of model-based analyses, and (3) foundations for easily configurable constructions of model-based analyses.
