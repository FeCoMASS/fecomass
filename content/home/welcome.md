<p style="font-size:65%;">Before realising a complex software-intensive system it is worth analysing its emerging properties. Analyses are applied for investigating systems for quality properties or properties specific to a given domain. Model-based analysis is the appropriate technique to do that early in development to avoid inappropriate design decisions and costly design flaws. For today’s heterogeneous and complex systems, analysis techniques become complex as well. To master the development of tailor-made analysis techniques, decomposition and composition of analyses is unavoidable. The very different nature of quality properties has led to the use of individual analysis techniques and independent tools for each quality property. Moreover, recently emerging innovations like internet of things and cyber-physical systems combine several domains, such as software, electrics/electronics and mechanics. In consequence, analyses need to be (de)composed along quality properties and domain-specific properties. The goal of the FeCoMASS project is to provide more flexibility in model-driven engineering by investigating foundations of decomposition and composition mechanisms specifically for model- based analyses for tomorrow’s increasingly heterogeneous and complex systems. For this purpose, we will investigate in (1) (de)compositional semantics for modelling languages and analysis techniques to ensure sound analysis results, (2) concepts and guidelines for flexible use and reuse of model-based analyses, and (3) foundations for easily configurable constructions of model-based analyses.</p>
